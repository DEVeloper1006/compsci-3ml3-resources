    "In high dimensions random search is no longer efficient. We therefore want to look at coordinate search and coordinate descent. For coordinate search, instead of generating $P$ (or num samples) random directions we only look for descent among the $2N$ coordinate directions. That means that the candidate directions to go to are always the same and can be fixed at the start (have a look at `np.eye`). For instance like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# construct set of all coordinate directions\n",
    "directions_plus = np.eye(np.size(w),np.size(w))\n",
    "directions_minus = - np.eye(np.size(w),np.size(w))\n",
    "directions = np.concatenate((directions_plus,directions_minus),axis=0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For coordinate search we go through all of these directions at every step and select the best one. In contrast, for coordinate descent we instead randomly go through the coordinate directions and the first time we find a descent we use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1: Implementing Coordinate Search & Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify your implementation of `random_search` to implement `coordinate_search` and `coordinate_descent`. In both cases, you must use normalized directions (multiplied by the steplength). Make sure you can go both in the postive and negative direction for each coordinate. In one dimension there would be two directions, forward and backward. In two dimensions there would be 4 directions: North, South, East and West. \n",
    "\n",
    "HINT: For coordinate descent have a look at `numpy.random.permutation`\n",
    "WATCH OUT FOR: For a fair comparison between the 2 algorithms you should allow `coordinate_descent` to attempt to take $N$ steps whenever `coordinate_search` takes one step. One way to do that is to generate a random permutation of the $2N$ directions and let coordinate descent run through them sequentially before generating another permutation, letting `max_its` count the number of permutations generated. So, if `max_its` is the maximum number of steps that coordinate search can take then coordinate descent could possibly take $N \\times$ `max_its` steps. Read section 2.6.2 in the text book.\n",

    "ANSWER: The implementation of `coordinate_search` and `coordinate_descent` is as follows:"
