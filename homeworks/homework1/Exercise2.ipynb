    "Let’s call the answer to the last point in the preceeding question `psum`. It should contain the sum of the square of the elements of each of the random vectors. To normalize them we simply need to do `np.sqrt(psum)`. Now, it would be great if could simply normalize the rows of directions using the statement: `directions = directions/norms`. Try it. It doesn’t work because of what in numpy is called broadcast rules, which we will discuss in more details later. In essence, numpy doesn’t know what to do because it doesn’t know enough about the shape of `norms`. We can fix that several different ways. For instance, we can do `norms.shape=(num samples,1)` or `norms=norms[:,newaxis]`. Using this, verify that each row of directions is normalized.\n",
